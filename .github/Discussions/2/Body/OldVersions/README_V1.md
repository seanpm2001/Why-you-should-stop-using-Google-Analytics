# This repository is badly glitched out

I have never seen such a glitched out repository. It is giving me errors everywhere. I can't star the project or its forks (but I can watch them, and other people can star them) the fork button is broken, and requires going to the fork page, every button on the ribbon gets stuck and has to be manually refreshed, there is always a constant error saying "Failed to load latest commit information" the discussions page is messed up and the downvote button is missing. I have tried deleting the project and re-creating it, but these errors remain. I don't know what caused it, maybe the Google Analytics keywords, or the fact that I started 4 repositories in 10 seconds. I even tried turning off uBlock Origin, but that didn't do anything either.

I am wondering if it will ever get fixed, or how soon it can get fixed (time of post: 4:34 pm, Tuesday, February 23rd 2021)
